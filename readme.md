# SAES wrap testing
This is a repo for testing wraps for the SAES:RPG MTA server.

## Installation
Download `RPGmodels.zip` [latest release](https://github.com/NanoBob/saesrpg-wrap-testing/releases/latest) from the latest release, and unzip it to your server resources directory, in a directory called `RPGmodels`. (Default filepath is `C:\Program Files (x86)\MTA San Andreas 1.5\server\mods\deathmatch\resources`)

Make sure the directory is called `RPGmodels`, if it is named otherwise it will not work.

## Usage
- Connect to your local server, and start the `RPGmodels` resource. This should load SAES' vehicle mods.
- Spawn a vehicle for yourself
- Enter the vehicle
- Use the command `/setShader <url-to-image>`.  
  (Replace `<url-to-image>` with a direct URL to the image for the wrap)
